# Contribution
Anyone can contribute to the solution, however the following process needs to be followed.

* Branch off the development branch and create a feature/<my new feature> branch
* Work in your respective branch
* Create a pull request
* Assign pull request to one of the technical leads or senior developers who own the solution
* Await pull request signoff or comments
* Technical lead or senior that did the review will be responsible for merging code

The above will ensure that all new code is reviewed and that the team that owns the code is aware of any changes.
